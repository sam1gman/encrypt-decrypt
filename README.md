These Python scripts provide functionality for encrypting and decrypting files using symmetric encryption provided by the cryptography library's Fernet encryption. The encryption script secures files by encrypting their contents, while the decryption script reverses this process to restore the original data.
Security: Ensure that the encryption key (thekey.txt) is securely stored, as it is required for both encryption and decryption.
File Safety: Backup files before running encryption or decryption processes to prevent accidental data loss.
Data Corruption Risk: If the encryption key does not match the key used to encrypt the files, or if the files were not encrypted by this script, decryption may result in corrupted data.
Key Security: Ensure that thekey.txt is correctly located and matches the key used for encryption. Mismanagement of the key can lead to data loss.
These scripts are designed to manage file encryption and decryption for securing and restoring data. Proper handling and security of the encryption key are critical to avoid data loss or corruption.
